# TMC2209 V3 Pin Socket Header (V1)

A custom **dual-row female header footprint** built for the **TMC2209 V3 stepper driver module** (2.54 mm pitch, 0.600 in spacing).  
It allows the driver to be **plugged in and out easily** — ideal for testing, replacement, or multi-axis motion-control setups.

### 🧩 Purpose

This footprint is designed for motion-control projects where stepper-motor drivers need to be modular and replaceable.  
The socket configuration lets you:
- Prototype new driver circuits quickly  
- Replace burned or defective drivers without re-soldering  
- Hot-swap between different Trinamic modules during tuning  
- Maintain a clean and serviceable wiring layout
