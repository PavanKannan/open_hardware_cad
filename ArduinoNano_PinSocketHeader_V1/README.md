# Arduino Nano Pin Socket Header (V1)

A custom dual-row **female socket header footprint** designed for Arduino Nano boards (30 pins, 2.54 mm pitch, 0.600 in spacing).  
This footprint enables **plug-in modular prototyping** — the Nano can be easily inserted or removed, making it simple to replace or upgrade components without re-soldering.

### 🧩 Purpose

Designed for projects that use the Arduino Nano as a removable control module.  
By using dual socket headers, you can:
- Prototype quickly with reusable boards  
- Replace defective or burned microcontrollers easily  
- Swap different Nano variants during testing  
- Maintain cleaner and serviceable PCB layouts
